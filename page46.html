            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Being in a relationship is a beautiful thing. Being in love and loved back is a wonderful feeling. <br><br>You have that one person you tell yourself you would go the extra mile for; catch a grenade for, so to speak. <br><br>As the relationship progresses, this person might chip away slowly at your personality to the point you forget who you were before the relationship started.<br><br> So how to maintain your individuality while you are in a relationship:
<div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1</strong>. Don’t break contact with your old friends:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>In the beginning of any relationship, you get so lost in each other that you forget that there is a life outside of you both. </div><br><div>You stop keeping in touch with your old friends to the point that you become strangers or even lose contact totally. </div><br><div>This is a mistake because you are denying yourself who to turn to if the person you are in love with hurts you. </div><br><div>One day, you are going to need somebody with whom you can talk your heart out to and there would be no one available.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Although it might not look like it, your real friends are always a call away, you just have to initiate contact.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>2</strong>. Take time out for yourself:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Have some “Me Time”. Do not forget that you were born as an individual entity. </div><br><div>So, always take time out for yourself and do those things that you used to do before you made the commitment. </div><br><div>You had things you did for fun and skills that you probably have stopped using, pick them up and keep doing them. If you are the type to take walks alone or cherish a bit of alone time, do not sacrifice it on the altar of love.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>3</strong>. Remain independent:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>This is very important. You have to do this for yourself. Never sacrifice your career goals because of the other person. </div><br><div>Don’t be afraid of chasing your dreams. You are as entitled to fulfilling your dreams as your significant other. </div><br><div>This is because there is a chance you would regret not chasing those dreams down when you think on it in later years. Especially if the person you made the sacrifice for betrayed your trust or the relationship.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Being independent is not just about your career but every part of your life. Do not settle.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>4</strong>. Self-respect is important:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>When in a relationship, do not force yourself to do things you are not comfortable doing or which attack your basic personality. </div><br><div>This is because, over time, you will get used to doing these things you would rather not to until you lose yourself in the process. </div><br><div>And when you realise this has happened, you begin to ask yourself why you let yourself go.</div><br><div> It is your life and the person who should be making the important decisions about it is you. The final decisions about life matters must be made by you. </div><br><div>Do not, for the sake of pleasing your partner, hand over the decision-making task. Be involved, have your say and let it be mutual.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>5</strong>. Over-commitment is the ultimate enemy:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Yes, you are very much in love but making big promises at the beginning can lead to problems later. </div><br><div>You might have to do over and beyond yourself to keep those promises you made. This is why people are advised not to make promises and decisions when they are very happy, sad or angry.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Of course, some people come into our lives and show us how to be better versions of ourselves. </div><br><div>But they do not force this change on others. They are patient and usually lead by example. Be particular about the type of change you want.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>6</strong>. Giving and taking space:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>A relationship binds two people together and obviously, people who love each other have a say in each other’s lives as well but sometimes the relationship can create a feeling of being strangled.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Giving space doesn’t mean separation but there are things that you should keep to yourself. Things that are personal. Like your log-in password. </div><br><div>And your better half is not entitled to informationabout conversations you had with friends, especially ones where you were entrusted with secrets.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>7</strong>. Plan trips with non-mutual friends:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Go out for a dinner with friends who are not common for both of you, this way your friends will never complain about not seeing you and you will feel rejuvenated. </div><br><div>It will turn out to be the ultimate fun time for you, you don’t have to care about what the friends will say to your partner about you, and you would be free to talk about everything and anything.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>8</strong>. Speak your heart out:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>This is a common mistake that we all make in a relationship. We tend to not say the things we want to or really feel because we do not want to hurt them. </div><br><div>Because we want to keep the peace; we do not want to rock the boat.</div><br><div>  
</div><div>
</div><div>It is okay to tell them where they are wrong right from the start. They will get used to it and can actually try to improve and you also get to say what you need to.</div></div>
