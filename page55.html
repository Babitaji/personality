        <div class="inner-container" style="width: 100%;">
            <hr class="line" style="width: 10%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">In a conversation, be it a job interview, with a group of people or even your significant other, the ability to convince them is a skill worth having. <br><br>You have of course listened to and come across people who with words convince people or get them to support their point of view. <br><br>You look at them, see how they have a vibrant energy and it looks like their words are sugar-coated. Don’t worry! You too can be that person. This is not an inborn or “God-given” skill. It is a product of practice and a combination of wit and intellect.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>Having said that, a fluency in the language you are speaking in is a must or else communication would not happen. </div><br><div>Even though it is said that actions speak louder than words, there are instances where, with the right words, spoken in the right tone and place, there would be no need for an action plan. </div><br><div>Let us see what you can do to develop your oratory skills.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1.  Use reverse psychology:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>There is a chance you have heard of this or have an idea of what it is. Reverse psychology is persuasion which involves getting another person to do or say something by telling them the opposite of what is desired. </div><br><div>The human mind is more scared than creative and usually acts defensively. You advocate for a thing such that the listener would rather do the opposite of what you are saying. </div><br><div>However, the listener does not know that what you really want is for him/her to do the opposite of what you are advocating for.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>I would, however, advise that this should be a last resort as it can backfire. Using reverse psychology can be seen as manipulative and would, on the long run, damage your relationship.  
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Do Your Homework Properly:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Do not take a position or argue on anything you do not have enough information about. Before entering into an argument or taking a position, make sure you have all or nearly all of the facts about the topic. </div><br><div>Carry out due diligence. Do your research and homework. Or not let yourself be caught off-guard. When you do this, it would be obvious that you know what you are talking about and others will listen. </div><br><div>Even with all the facts, do not close yourself off. Be open to opposition and constructive discussions. And if ever you feel cornered, do not raise your voice or resort to insults. </div><br><div>Take your time. It is okay to admit you do not know about a thing. No one has all the knowledge. If possible, ask for time to go and find out so you can give a befitting reply.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Once again, never raise your voice, raise your game.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Play the visual card:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Be imaginative. Play the visual card. Take your listener on an imaginative journey. Don’t just keep talking. </div><br><div> Create a picture in their mind that would stick because visual memories last longer than spoken words. To do this, in the course of a speech, you can give suitable and appropriate examples which listeners can relate to. </div><br><div>Avoid being too detailed with the stories/examples as this might cause your listener to lose the thread of the point you are trying to make.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Be assertive:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Remember, you don’t have to talk continuously or for a long period in order to be persuasive or to get your point across. </div><br><div>Know what to say, when to s<span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));">ay it and how to say it. It is also good to know your audience/listener. Be assertive. Have a pose. You should really avoid talking too long because you would start looking like a blabbermouth which is a huge roadblock to being persuasive. </span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));">This does not mean you should be needlessly aggressive or condescending or come across as overconfident. Just make sure you are discussing the right things, and in brief, understandable ways.</span></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Be calm:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>As earlier mentioned, do not raise your voice or speak aggressively. Listen actively when others are speaking. Yes, actively. </div><br><div>It lets others know you are interested in what they are saying and respect their opinion, even if you don’t agree with it. In a situation where you are speaking to a hostile crowd, it is very important to stay calm. Very. Or else, you would lose total control of the narrative and whatever it is you say or want to say, would be booed.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>6. Look confident:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You need to believe that you are as good as the next person. Do not question your ability. </div><br><div>Don’t sell yourself short. When talking, don’t fidget. Maintain eye contact at all times, smile, and if need be, crack a joke. Let the listener and everyone else know that you are comfortable and know what you are about.</div><br><div> This also includes your dress. Dress sharp. All ironed, correct combinations, well-groomed hair and a well-shined shoe or clean footwear. No one gives the time of day to someone who looks shabby.
