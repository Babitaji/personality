<div>
</div><div>&nbsp; Time is the most fickle thing that we may ever come across. It deludes us into believing that we have enough of it but in reality, we hardly have any of it left.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It takes more than an ordinary man to understand the importance of managing time. One who has lost something or someone because of time knows how to value it.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Time is a relative concept. Seconds become important when you meet with an accident, minutes become important when chasing the train/bus and an hour becomes important when you are due to submit assignments.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; If you are always cribbing about how time flies quickly, here are few tips to manage your time well :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1 - Plan your work :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>There are tasks that are to be done daily. Identify the best method to complete the task in the least amount of time.
</div><div>
</div><div>Those tasks that require more time should be reviewed while carrying out mundane tasks such as traveling, bathing, and cooking. Plan the schedule for the next day before you go to sleep.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2 - Say ‘No’ to excessive social media :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Your virtual life may be important, but do not over indulge in it. It is better to engage in some productive work than in the ‘Brag-Race.’</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3 - Keep yourself hydrated and well-fed :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Amidst an important task if you suddenly start experiencing hunger pangs or your throat feels parched, then you may have to take a compulsory break. It is better to eat in small proportions when you take a break in between work.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4 - Important tasks first :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It goes without saying that important tasks need to be done as soon as you are set to start the day. Once you are done with the important tasks, you can free your mind of that nagging feeling and clutter.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5 - Do not multitask :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Better to focus on the work at hand rather than concentrating half-heartedly on multiple things at once.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>6 - Allocate time-limit and leave a room for breaks :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Doing this may help you cope with work if you are lagging and will keep you on track. Breaks help in increasing productivity.
</div><div>
</div><div>You are the one who has the power to shape your future. Spend your time wisely!
