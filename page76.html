            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Sonya Parker has rightly said, “Almost everyone will make a first good impression, but only a few will make a good lasting impression.”<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>Your impression is an essential thing when it comes to making a mark for yourself in every aspect of your life, may it be a career, marriage, making friends, etc. </div><br><div>Things were easier in the past because there was no need to groom your social media impression since it didn’t exist yet. In this 21st century, your virtual impressions speak for you and hence, it becomes inevitable to leave an everlasting impression to get that dream job, spouse or recognition.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Here are the tips on how to improve social media impression:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Keep it original :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Who would like to have a duplicate or second-hand version of someone else? The recruiters, friends, family members and that someone special is looking at your profile to get a glimpse of the real you rather than someone who is impersonating some distant relative or a celebrity. Too many filters on your selfies are so not trending nowadays.</div><div><br></div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Clean the trash :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Lots of unknown people and posts may clutter your social media profiles. Steer away from them for you may not always be able to control and filter their activities and it will keep popping up on your timeline. </div><br><div>Be friends with only those whom you actually know. No embarrassing stuff online, please!</div><br><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Filter your data :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Read your posts, comments, tweets, and hashtags before you post, pin, poke, tweet anything on social media sites. You have a lot of critics waiting to judge you. </div><br><div>Do not clutter up your profile with unnecessary stuff. Be sure of what you want others to perceive about you.</div><div><br></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Stop being a narcissist :</div><br><div>A narcissist is highly self-obsessed with his/her looks, photographs, posts and what not. You should not be a part of such a rat race. Time your uploads. </div><br><div>They should be moderately timed. You do not need to tag everyone for every selfie that you upload. Neither do you need to like or comment on everything that others post.</div><div><br></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Be humble and classy :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Do not act like you own the world. You may think so, but do not act that way. Be humble in your virtual demeanor too.</div><br><div> Always remember that what goes on the World Wide Web shall remain on the Net forever. You cannot delete it completely. It is better to be careful than sorry.</div></div>
