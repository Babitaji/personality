            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Staying healthy while trying to keep to a tight schedule -work, exercise, and social life- can sometimes be an uphill task. <br><br>The first, and probably most important goal, for a healthy body is to have atleast 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep everyday. Much as this may be difficult with the hours you have to put in at work, if one puts his/her mind to it, one eventually gets the hang of it.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>Productivity is affected by body metabolism and boosting it would have a positive effect on the former.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>There are, however, ways to get the most out of your day using cheat tricks that would be discussed below. </div><br><div>These activities would boost your productivity in all aspects of your life, not just work. Of course, when you think about it, you get more free time!! How? you ask. </div><br><div>Well, with boosted efficiency and effectiveness, you finish your tasks early and are able to rest more.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Below are listed 5 easy-to-do tips to boost your metabolism and increase productivity.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>1</strong>. Full Glass of Cold Water Everyday:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The keyword here is “cold water”. Drinking a glass of cold water has an ample number of health benefits one of which is boosting your metabolism. Drinking a glass full of cold water speeds up your booting process when you just get off the bed. This feeling of activeness would last you through the day.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>2</strong>. Lift Things Up:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Basically, this is a workout strategy to boost up your metabolism. This is preferably done on an empty stomach and in the morning. </div><br><div>The reason for this is to get the body system all up and working before the first meal is ingested. It would allow for a more efficient use of the food and avoid fat build-up. </div><br><div>However, make sure that you do not go overboard with the weightlifting! This means you should take note of how heavy what you are carrying is and not lift what would cause you pain. The trick is to start small and add more weight as you go on.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>3</strong>. One Fruit In The Morning:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>We all know the proverb “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”. </div><br><div>Much as this is not all you need to do, fruits play a vital role in keeping the body healthy. This is why, growing up, your mom most probably put a fruit with your lunch pack. </div><br><div>Pick your favorite fruit from the shelf, preferably an apple or a banana and make it a habit to eat one every morning.Fruits contain a plethora of vitamins and minerals that help in energizing your body. </div><br><div>It is also advisable to eat a fruit after lunch as well but if this is not possible, stick to the morning fruit rule.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>4</strong>. Go Green WithGreen Tea and Oolong Tea:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The fat and starch ingested do not only end up as excess fat but also end up making you lethargic; you get tired quicker and become slow as the day progresses. </div><br><div>Drinking a cup of green or oolong tea helps in turning those layers of fats into fatty acids which are easy for the body to make use of and also flush out. The teas would aid you in losing excess weight and help you attain that fit and trim look.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>5</strong>. Switch to the Coconut Oil:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>If, by now, you are not using coconut oil for your cooking, make the switch. </div><br><div> Research has shown that coconut oil contains medium chain fats (the good fat) while the everyday cooking oil is rich in long-chain fats which make you feel drowsy and slow down your metabolism. </div><br><div>Coconut oil has been found to boost the body metabolism by at least 15%, which even beats the benefit got from taking green tea.
