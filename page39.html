            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Hearing the same thing – “You should be disciplined to make yourself a big shot in life.” <br><br>You must have realized that this one is quite important and has immense power in it. <br><br>However, this obvious and well-known truth itself is not abided by everybody in this world. <br><br>Let alone considering everybody, not even 10% of the world’s population are successful in making themselves completely disciplined.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>Now, many would think that what fun lies in living life by a rule book and having no fun! Right? If you are having thoughts like this too, then you are getting it totally wrong. </div><br><div>You must realize that being disciplined is nowhere related to living a life without any fun element in it. </div><br><div>NO! What all it means is simply to sort and order your productive time so you can be ultra-productive and successful in the end. Let us know some hacks to help us be more disciplined. </div><br><div>Here are a few:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Face your Weakness:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Having control over your resistance power does not actually lie in avoiding things that weaken you in the knees, but to stay put and face them like a boss. </div><br><div>If you want, there is a little fun technique – Place your favorite delicacy near you and try to avoid it while putting your whole concentration into your work.</div><br><div> Gradually, you will be able to resist it without feeling a thing. Now, realize that the chocolate there corresponds to everything that acts as a weakness in your life.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Make Your Body Align With Your Mind:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Next, you have got to put the focus on your body. Exercise? Yes – Regularly moving your body in the morning can help you relax your mind as well (yes, both are connected). </div><br><div>Don’t procrastinate and be sure to go that extra mile, as you will see a lesser crowd there. Plus, once you stick to the routine, it will be tougher for you to stop afterward. </div><br><div>To make your mind and body work on the same page, you must focus on your brain and work on your body.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3.  Make No Room For Regrets:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>One of the greatest leeches in everybody’s lives is that horrifying thought of the past. </div><br><div>Do you really want to be the person who would rather live to crib about their past? No – then don’t and start living for now. </div><br><div>What happened in the past should be locked up in a box and should be kicked out of your mind as soon as possible. </div><br><div>Another fun technique for this would be to write the things you regret onto a piece of paper and flush it out, in all literal sense. It would help get it out of your system as well.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Don’t Make It Hard on Yourself:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>See, as mentioned earlier, being in a disciplined zone doesn’t mean that you should stay out of having a social life or kick every fun element from your life, as nobody on this Earth can possibly do that. </div><br><div>Rather, you must realize that being disciplined simply means to know about yourself even more. </div><br><div>We live in a world where we tend to care about others more than we should and on the contrary, we care about selfless than we should. Create a perfect balance and treat yourself with something you like from time to time.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>5.  Never Set More Than One Alarm to Wake Yourself Up:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Have you ever realized that the more alarms you put on your phone to wake you up, the more you lose faith in your abilities? </div><br><div>You need to stop this right away! Start setting just one alarm and if you miss it – it’s your loss. </div><br><div>But you will realize that from next time, so you will start having zeal within to wake up on the call of a single alarm. </div><br><div>Don’t snooze and start being active and alert even when you are sleeping.</div></div>
