            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">We all are daydreamers. Taking those few moments to think of what could be, what we want to be and all other wishes we hope will come true. <br><br>This might seem like a waste of time especially in the fast-paced world we now live in where everyone one is expected to utilise time to the fullest. <br><br>Everyone is expected to be super-productive and daydreaming is now viewed as a blatant waste of time. <br><br>However, daydreaming has advantages and some are listed here.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>1. Dream big:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>As the saying goes, dreaming is cheap. It costs you no money so if you are going to dream, dream big. Let your imagination run wild and consider all possibilities; both the real and the imaginary. </div><br><div>There is no problem in dreaming big. I have heard many people say one should dream within limits but this is so wrong. It is a false notion which we are fed and which we should kick out of our minds. </div><br><div>The mind is boundless and can imagine any and everything, Do not shortchange yourself.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Trust in your dreams:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You will encounter many people as you grow who would either look down on your dream or tell you it is an impossible one. They would tell you, you cannot do it or should settle for what you have. </div><br><div>Do not let such people have a say in your decisions. Live your best life. Believe in your dreams. The richest man in the world started with just an idea which seemed impossible at that time. You have to dream big and work big to be successful. </div><br><div>So, stay positive and let no one and don’t let your imaginations be maligned by someone’s negative words.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Think about the obstacles:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>When planning to turn your dreams to reality, you must think about the obstacles as well. It is a given that the bigger the dream, the more obstacles in the way of achieving it. </div><br><div>Therefore, it is important to know these obstacles in order to have a plan in place to overcome them when they come up. Though it is impossible to prepare for all eventualities, it is still good to be prepared for the ones you believe might come up. Fortune favours the prepared.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Be practical with your expectations:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You can’t build an empire in a single day, things take time. Also, if you think you can start a very big business and you have no capital in hand, it won’t be feasible, so think practically, look I am not saying you to limit your dreams but there is a lot of difference in reality and dreams.
</div><div>&nbsp; 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Give your Imaginations a direction:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It’s a proven fact that you can actually train your mind into thinking about instances according to your choice. You can also complete a dream this way. When you come up against an obstacle in your head, do not stop. Work around it. Chart new possibilities. 
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>6. Write down your dreams:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Keeping a record of your dreams is actually a very good idea as it allows you to keep track of your thoughts and the ideas that pop up as you daydream. </div><br><div>The human brain is the biggest central processing unit but it also is somewhat unreliable as we tend to forget things or not remember them immediately we need them. </div><br><div>Writing things down would also aid the planning.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Daydreaming is a very good thing. It enhances our creative side and also increases brain productivity. It also helps us plan for our future, teaches us patience, and improves our observation and problem-solving skills.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>7. Work towards making those dreams reality:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Dreaming about a thing is useless without putting in the effort to make the dream happen. It is nothing but a waste of time to just lay about dreaming without work</div></div>
