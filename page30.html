</div><div>1. Silence:</div><div><br></div><div>Did you ever notice the essence and power of silence during the day? If not, then you are missing out on something very powerful. After you wake up, take your mind to either a complete silent zone or indulge into spirituality for 5 minutes.</div><br><div>

</div><div>
</div><div>If you are a night owl, you should do this to keep you woke up during the early hours of the morning. </div><br><div>Not much just 7 minutes of stretching out would do the job. All you have to make sure about that is to be regular in it and not to quit in between.</div><br><div>

</div><div>
</div><div>Don’t wait for long to take a shower, just do it after your workout. Also, remember that you do not want to spend more than 5 minutes in taking a shower every morning. Also, never pamper yourself to sleep with warm water but splash cold water on yourself.</div><br><div>
