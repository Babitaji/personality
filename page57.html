<div>
</div><div>Being shy can be beneficial if you know how to tackle it well. Shyness generally develops from the feeling of insecurity. </div><br><div>It could be concerned about how people will judge you. It can particularly ruin your chances with the opposite gender because they may mistakenly assume your silence to be self-centeredness. </div><br><div>You must be approachable to be liked and for that, overcoming your shyness is essential. Other people may find your shyness endearing if you display it in a moderate amount without being awkward.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Here is what you can do to overcome shyness with the opposite sex:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1) Define what you want to be:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>You will have to define how you wish people to perceive you. You can pose as either a wallflower or a charming person. Follow through the act then. If you wish to be charming, start acting like it.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2) Do not be too critical of yourself:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Do not judge yourself harshly. Nobody, not even God can please all. You are merely a human being and you are allowed to make a faux pas. Let it go. Retain what truly defines you without thinking about how you will be judged.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3) Be confident while striking a conversation:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>If you have already dared to start a conversation with the opposite sex then go with it no matter what. </div><br><div>Take it as an opportunity to experience how well you can perform. Exude confidence. The other person doesnâ€™t need to know how shy you are. And you can also admit that you are anxious. Both can work for you.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4) Find something of common interest:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>When you have something in common, the conversation flows easily and naturally. You can make such a conversation stimulating with your passion for a common subject.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5) Observe and imitate:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>When you are unsure of how to talk to the other person, observe his/her stance and style of talking. If you imitate the same, the other person will get the signal that you are interested in talking to him/her. It will also raise your confidence.</div></div>
