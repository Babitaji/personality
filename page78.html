It is definitely hard to move on after a breakup. A breakup is never a second’s decision. <br><br>It will surely have a long tail of fights, misunderstandings, rejections and hurts. When reconciliation is not possible, you have to break it up and there is no other go.<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>It makes difficult to be normal in everyday life after losing a beloved person. But it is a must to move with the time and feelings once broken cannot be re-joined.

Stop hard feelings and think everything is uncertain in life. </div><br><div>Here are few suggestions to help you move on happily with your breakup.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Let it go : </div><br><div>Anything is possible in a relationship. And you can’t always hold onto something it will never happen. Take a deep breath and say yourself let it go.</div><div><br></div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Get rid of treasured gifts and memories : </div><br><div>Gifts and cards from your lover may kill you again and again. Burn them all along with your feelings. It takes most off your pain of a breakup.</div><div><br></div><br><div>
