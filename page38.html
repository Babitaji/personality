            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Almost each one of us has a fear of something or the other. Apart from being different in nature, these fears also occur to different people with different intensities. <br><br>Most of these leave a very strong impression on our subconscious mind while others can be stuck with us due to a tragic history of a miserable event. One of these phobias or a severe kind of fear is “Phasmophobia” which is nothing but a fear of supernatural powers, particularly ghosts. <br><br>It is no surprise to know that if these kinds of fear are not dealt timely and with proper care, can lead to severe consequences. On the contrary, supernatural and paranormal science is a widely popular and debatable topic where different sets of people argue with different standpoints. In this article, we will let you know more about Phasmophobia.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>The Symptoms:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Unfocused Mind for a Greater Part of The Day:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Feeling out of the blue sometimes is a different thing while being totally paranoid and unfocused for a greater part of the day is yet another serious thing that needs your attention as soon as possible. </div><br><div>Being unfocused, lacking energy and being in a panic state are some of the feelings that if altogether sums up your day then you should consider getting a professional help.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Rapid Heartbeat or Unconsciousness:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The symptoms will start taking a toll or could go to a severe level if either your heartbeat starts bumping heavily or you would start getting unconscious for no apparent reason. However, you would find the same set of symptoms while in depression too but in either of cases, you should seek medical help as soon as you can.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Feeling of Terror:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>If you start feeling the presence of someone even when you are alone then either your mind is playing tricks on you or you are having one of the symptoms of Phasmophobia. </div><br><div>Phasmophobia basically affects your brain and start controlling it in a completely unnatural way that you would not expect it to behave normally. A constant feeling of terror sticks with you every single time.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Insomnia or Constant Dreaming:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Again, these two can happen due to overthinking or can happen due to Phasmophobia as well. If you are having trouble sleeping in a day or on the other hand, if you are feeling miserable after sleeping or are getting constant horrifying dreams in your sleep then you might be experiencing one of the symptoms of Phasmophobia. </div><br><div>Either of these two should be treated as soon as possible and with utmost care and proper guidance.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><em>How to treat?
</em></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Yoga or Breathing Exercise:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Phasmophobia is basically nothing but a worst case of hypertension, anxiety and panic attacks. </div><br><div>That leads to an excellent solution – Yoga. Practicing yoga and breathing exercises can actually improve your drastic condition to a whole another level. </div><br><div>It is one of the best self-help methods that would help you in deeply relaxing your mind and getting away from any negative thought that develops.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. TALK:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The main objective is to simply take out every negative image or a fear from your body. </div><br><div>You can talk about your condition or about your experiences with somebody who is either a professional or knows you well enough. </div><br><div>Never feel shy or be in a shell while talking as it is one of the cognitive therapies to get out of Phasmophobia completely. </div><br><div>Talking also helps in self-realization that whatever that is troubling you only do reside in your mind and you should flush it out from there.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Know Which Kind of Medical Help You Need:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Phasmophobia, if not dealt with on time can cause a serious brain disorder. </div><br><div>Hence, if anything is seriously troubling you to the core then you should never think twice about getting a professional help. First off, talk to a concerned doctor and don’t feel shy about telling them about how you feel. </div><br><div>Next, they would guide you with proper brain exercises and medications (if necessary) to help you push back your fear.</div></div>
