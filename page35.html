            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">They say “Behind every successful man there is a woman”, indeed, it is true but the fact is only when you know how to keep her happy. <br><br>All of us want our life to be happy personally and professionally, and by personally I mean in terms of our partners and family. <br><br>A happy wife means a happy life but how many of us really know this art of keeping our girlfriends, wives or partners happy? Have a look<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>1. Don’t Act Desperate:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Guys, this is a warning if you don’t have a girlfriend and are planning to make one, I mean if you are seeing someone, or are friends with someone you like, don’t try to get too clingy or desperate to be in a relationship with them, take things slow, the more you try the more they will go away.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Girls Want Pampering and Sweet Talks:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Every one of us wants to be pampered like a kid, but this is more so with girls. Moreover, they want someone in their life who can take care of them like a father. And here is a tip, a girl’s heart can be melted and won just by talking sweetly, try it!
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Respect Her and Her Family:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>A girl can go to any measures to keep you happy but once she starts to think that her self-respect is at the stake, there is no turning around, also respect her family as much as you want her to respect yours.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Be Supportive:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>In this male chauvinistic society, there could be nothing better than a partner or boyfriend who can support a girl in her career-related decisions. </div><br><div>Support her when she needs you emotionally, you don’t have to say anything just listen to what she has to say.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Be Ambitious but Not Too Much:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It is good to be career oriented but doesn't forget your girl in the process, she wants your time and not your money, if you think you can keep her happy with expensive gifts then you are absolutely wrong my dear!
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>6. Trust her and Give Her Freedom:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Trust is an important factor in any relationship, a relationship is hollow without trust, love is not enough there are other things like trust that bind a relationship, so you need to trust her and her decisions. </div><br><div>If she wants to hang out with her friends don’t stop her, rather encourage her, you will also get some time with your friends.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>7. Don’t Force Her to Do Things:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>There are certain things which you would like, such as taking your relationship to a next level but don’t force her to do things she is not comfortable with. Understand that, she has certain limitations and morals she can’t break and of course, she has a will of her own.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>8. Admit your Mistakes:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>If you have done something wrong admit it before she hears it from someone else, it can be very disheartening for her if someone else would tell her the truth. And of course, she will start doubting you in future. </div><br><div>Naturally, she would get angry at you, but after knowing your reasons, she will forgive you.
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>9. Make Her Feel Special:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You don’t need to plan big surprises for her, a single rose, a teddy bear would make her happy like never before. And if you really want to plan big, sing a song, write a love letter for her, yes! These are big things.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Make her feel wanted in your life, she should feel that she matters to you, take her advice in making big decisions of your life. </div><br><div>A few little things can make your life much more happening.</div></div>
