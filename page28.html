            <hr class="line" style="width: 10%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">This world is a rat trap and we all are caught up in this trap in some way or the other. <br><br>Our life is full of desires, of love, of family, of materialistic things like money and luxuries which in turn ends up in attachment either with a person, a thing, it can be anything.<br><br>"Have you trusted someone so much that when that person broke your trust you were devastated?” or “have you lost a very precious thing and it felt like the end of the world!”, well don’t worry it’s not just you, every human is attached to something or someone in a way,<br><br> I don’t think that even the saints who claim to be happy and detached with the so-called “Maya” of this world are saying the truth, I mean who knows? 
<div>
</div><div>But there has to be some way we can lessen this attachment, let’s see how.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1. The Only Thing Constant is Change:
</div><div>
</div><br><div><span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));">Every person that has come in this world will have to go. Anyone that guarantees you that he will stay with you forever is lying because there is no guarantee, I may sound negative but this is the reality, you would have to realise that you can not hold onto anyone or anything for a very long time, so think well before you make a precious thing, person or an animal your habit. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Stop being Dependent:</div><div><br></div><div>You know where the problem lies? Inside us, We give the control of our happiness to others, if we treat ourselves as a completely different entity and not be dependent on anyone, we will be the happiest. Don’t be dependent on anything, by anything I don’t mean just people, it can be your dependency on any habit or a materialistic thing, you might have a habit of sleeping in an AC room, what if the electricity and the inverter stop working for a night? You won’t be able to sleep. </div><br><div>What if you don’t get to wear your favorite jewelry at an event for some reason? , let’s say you don’t have your lucky pen to write with, in an exam, you could fail man! The only thing that should remain with you at any point of time should be you and your working mind, that’s it, apart from it nothing should be compulsory.</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Make yourself Strong:</div><div><br></div><div>Look the first step that we are going to take towards detachment is by making ourselves strong.Think about it, why do we need someone to go with us when we have some work?, why can’t we be sufficient for ourselves, is it necessary to always have a person to entertain us?, No! Absolutely not!</div><br><div>
</div><div>Just keep yourself healthy, mentally and physically, cry when you have to, vent out your feelings, feel every emotion, don’t let it subside with the help of addiction like smoking or drinking and I promise you will get stronger day by day.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Expectations lead to Disappointment:</div><div><br></div><div>Look we do something for someone, it’s natural to expect something in return but why?
</div><div>Because we don’t do things for others to make ourselves happy, we do it because we think that the other person will be happy if I do this and he will think good about me or maybe the other time I ask for favors he will do it for me as well.</div><div><br></div><div>Just stop there, don’t do things out of your way to make others happy, do it because you will be happy after seeing their smile. Don’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Rome wasn’t built in a day:</div><div><span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));">Every process requires time, starting today, make yourself realize that everything is temporary in this world. Any detachment is going to take time and efforts from your side. Ask yourself “Is a relationship worth the amount of time you are giving into it?” , “do you think that the disobedient child you have is going to take care of you when you get old ?, is it worth to spend your entire money sponsoring is Tomorrowland ticket?”; Bad decision! Instead, give the same time to your own interests, plan trips, travel the world.</span><br></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>6. Everything including your feelings is temporary:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Be it money, people, pets, things like car jewelry, everything, even your feelings are temporary.
</div><div>The friend that you thought will be with you forever, you don’t even talk to her!; The bike that was your life two years back is in the garage waiting for you to clean it. , The person you loved so dearly, you don’t even want to see his or her face. Why so much of drama then? Apply your mind, think logically?</div><br><div>
</div><div>Was your lost scrapbook in the fifth standard worth crying for? Okay forgiven, you are a kid back then, but even now you cry for a little thing like a lost pair of jeans. After a year it won’t even matter.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Even if you have lost someone or something which was precious to you, give it some time, you will either forget it or will learn to live with it, but be patient.</div></div>
