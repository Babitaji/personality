            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">“It is even better to act quickly and err than to hesitate until the time of action is past”- Carl von Clausewitz”<br><br>  
<div>
</div><div>The fear of facing a lot of consequences can lead to hesitation and uneasiness. When you are expecting something, nervousness and anxiety can occur due to over analysing of the situations. </div><br><div>This way, it can make you go into depression, get angry, develop an eating disorder and whatnot. Over thinking a situation is bad for the mind and health alike.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Here are a few pointers to keep hesitation and uneasiness at bay</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Relax <strong>:</strong></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It may sound clichéd, but relaxation has its own value. You can keep your mind extremely busy so that the current uncertainty of events does not bother you. </div><br><div>Having a hobby, reading a book, taking brisk evening walks, exercising, or watching TV can help you relax in a positive way. </div><br><div>Being nervous about something will not lead to anything positive, so it will be better if you make use of the free time that you have until you get busy.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Ask yourself a few questions <strong>:</strong></div><div>
</div><div><br></div><div>One of them is, ‘What is the worst that can happen?’ By analysing the consequences of the situation, it can help you relax and quit being nervous altogether. </div><br><div>You can even ask yourself, ‘why am I over thinking this?’ Once you ask such a question, you will realise that it will lead to nothing but sadness and depression. So, quit being hesitant and challenge you own mind for the better.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Create a schedule and stick to it <strong>:</strong></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Hesitation and uneasiness occurs due to not making any actual contributions when there was time. Hence, being nervous at the last moment will only make you erratic and dysfunctional. </div><br><div>By sticking to a schedule, you can avoid the last minute jitters and overcome uneasiness.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Is it fear or discomfort? <strong>:</strong></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>When you ask yourself whether it is fear of the consequences or just that you are uncomfortable about the situation that is happening will help you analyse your behaviour pattern. </div><br><div>Do you get nervous very easily? Or is this something you face rarely? Hence, this will make your mind clearer about the ideas in your head. This way, you will be able to build your thoughts rationally and avoid becoming anxious or stressed over the issue.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Remember, it can either be success or a learning (not failure) <strong>:</strong></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Humans are bound to fear from failures, but in real life scenarios, a term called failure does not exist. </div><br><div>It is either success or learning, nothing besides that. So, if the term failure is out of your dictionary, the feeling of fear will not come into your mind. Start a project with a clear prospect of learning, then 99 out of 100 chances you will experience a success as the end result. Remember a wise man said, “I have not failed 100 times, I discovered 100 ways which cannot take me to the goal.” </div><br><div>The motive of this statement is clear that in case you are not able to achieve success, at the least you will know that there are a few alterations needed in the way you followed to fulfil a particular goal.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>6. Create a back-up plan <strong>:</strong></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Remember, you will never hesitate if you have a backup plan in place. </div><br><div>An example for this can be taken from our school period. When we are used to attending the school parents’ meeting, then most of us are hesitant to meet the subject teacher which we never studied, though we knew our parents must have a backup plan for us so that we can excel in that subject. </div><br><div>That is why we took them to the subject teacher to discover our mistake and help us with a solution. In a similar way, there should always be a Plan B ready, whenever you sense  failure can be an outcome, so that in case you fail, you can go ahead with the Plan B straight away.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>7. Have a Plan to implement<strong> :</strong></div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Goals are never achieved overnight, they are always achieved with a particular plan. </div><br><div>An unplanned lead has more of a chance of failure, then a well-planned and organized way of doing something. </div><br><div>The biggest advantage of planning is that it gives you an idea of the time, money and other aspects related to the goal, hence the uneasiness is eradicated completely.&nbsp;</div></div>
