            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Lion- the leader of the jungle. Everyone wishes to be the LION of his group. Everyone wants to be the leader and lead the group. <br><br>And by being a leader, that person wants to REIGN the group. If it is so, that person doesn't know the meaning of leadership and needs to go through this article.<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>A leader is a person who represents the group on behalf of all the team members. We all know that a leader must be cool, calm, a good listener and everything. </div><br><div>It is very quite true. If a person just throws ideas and orders on his members, he is not called a leader. Not to forget that he is also just a member, just that he has more responsibilities than other people and he needs to manage all those responsibilities. </div><br><div>Describing him in one word, he is the manager of the group.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Being a leader, first of all, you must take views from every member. You merge all the decisions and make the final decision by contributing some modifications on your basis.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Whenever a problem arises, it is you who need to keep calm first. Distribute the load of various people and not just randomly. A good leader knows his members quite well. so distribute loads on appropriate person. </div><br><div>Like for example, if any report is to be prepared, you can hand it to a person good at writing content, and not to someone who is in marketing section.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Inevitably, your group will face successes and failures. It is to the entire group that the result belongs, whether a success or a failure. A leader doesn't grab away success all by himself.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>To be a good leader, think of yourself as a tree and your members as your branches. If you will grow, so will your branches. When you will fall, so will your branches. And without branches, you are worthless!</div></div>
