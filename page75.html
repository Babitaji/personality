            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">&nbsp;“At some point you grow out of being attracted to that flame that burns you over and over again”- Taylor Swift<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>&nbsp; It is common to be attracted to someone who is completely wrong for us. When it comes to crushes, seeing the person in school or in the work place can make your tongue go dry, elevate your heartbeat and make your palms sweaty. </div><br><div>Such attractions make us think about that person all day involuntarily. It hinders our work skills, personality and can even cause embarrassing moments.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; Here are a few ways how to stop thinking about the person:</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Imagine a future together :</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;If that person is wrong for you, being together will bring a lot of consequences that will question your attachment in the first place. </div><br><div>You might end up hurting someone emotionally, or cause a disturbance in your social life and end up getting disbarred by your family. When you think about such grave consequences, you will naturally have a feeling to avert the person from your mind.</div><br><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Close yourself off from that person emotionally :</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>To get yourself emotionally detached from the person, the best way is to list and think about all the negative qualities of that person, as this will help you demotivate your attraction. </div><br><div>Another very effective way is to list reasons for the incompatibility of both of you. This will help you stay strong while you ignore that special person.</div><br><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Avoid seeing him/her altogether :</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Checking out his/her profile picture in secrecy and stalking his other social media accounts will only lead to madness and make you think more about the person. </div><br><div>You might end up making a mistake and embarrass yourself. So, by deleting his contact or avoiding any chance of him showing up in your news feed will clear out your mind. Like the old people say, out of sight, out of mind.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Change your focus :</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>If you still cannot get over being drawn to that person, you can change the focus entirely. You can look for other and better options that will suit your required matches and not make you feel guilty for getting attracted to the wrong person.</div><br><div> You can try a new method like every time you think about the person; you will have to put a dollar in the jar. This way, by the end you will find yourself thinking about the person.</div></div>
